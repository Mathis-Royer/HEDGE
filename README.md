# HEDGE Project
Main repository of HEDGE project - Algorithmic trading

## 🎯  Motivations

The ambition of the HEDGE project is to bring together Finance and Data Science enthusiasts to create a relatively high-frequency automatic trading algorithm, based on Deep Learning technologies and taking into account all the issues essential to quantitative speculative investment.
I.e. data that is reliable, complete and representative of the state of the financial markets at a given time.

## 💟  Ethics

The vision of the members of this project is to be able to offer a high-yield investment solution that limits as far as possible the negative impact of finance, and particularly high-frequency trading, on the global economy, the environment and human rights.
Limiting the negative impact of the HEDGE project is obviously imperative, but having a positive impact is also essential.
That's why this project also aims to determine how finance can help meet the social challenges of today and tomorrow.

## 👨🏼‍💻Teams🧑🏾‍💼

This project is structured into two main teams: 
- The Data Science team: in charge of developing the Deep Learning algorithm and all that this entails (data gathering, Data Preparation, Model Planning, Model Building, Efficient Evaluation of Results, Operationalize).
- The Finance team: in charge of investment strategy(ies), risk management, backtest evaluation.

## 📊  Data

The data collected to feed the Deep Learning model will come from a wide variety of sources. Here is a non-exhaustive list, which may evolve over time and with the conclusions of each team:
- Level 1: OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close).
- Level 2: k most price trade during last j minutes and there average volume.
- Volumes: Tick volume, Profile volume.
- Meta data: correlation between assets, macroeconomic data, etc.

## 📈  Risk Management

We believe that risk management is a more important factor than return in the search for an investment solution. That's why risk management is and will remain our guiding principle throughout the development of the HEDGE project, and across all our teams. We're convinced that artificial intelligence will make risk management strategies even more effective.
